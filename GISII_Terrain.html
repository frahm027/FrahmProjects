<h2>Terrain Analysis</h2>
<p>This was one of my favourite assignments in my GIS II class. Topography maps have always 
been my favorite to look at so playing around with elevation data is always fun. 
The assignment was to analyze Duluth's terrain to rate the level of danger for roads 
in winter and to plot the best route to the UMD campus depending on if you are walking or biking.</p>
<p>The map to the left is a simple contour map that looks nice and detailed from the hillshade effect on it.</p>

<p>Depending on if you are biking or walking in Duluth the route you take is important 
due to the differing slopes of roads. On a bike one would probably take a gradual sloped 
route even it was longer and if walking I thought it would be easier to take the short and 
steep route. For this assignment it was specifically looking for the best route from Burrito 
Union (local restaurant) to the UMD Campus. These two routes are definitely the fastest, 
but if I was actually at Burrito Union I would walk along Chester Creek through the park to 
get to UMD because it is a very nice walk. <i>The creek can be seen along the left side of the aerial photo.</i> </p>

<p>Roads in Duluth can be treacherous, the ice/snow on the steep roads can make your car go 
backwards in some cases. It was determined that road sections that had a slope greater than 
15% and an aspect angle between 270 and 90 degrees were the most dangerous. All colored 
sections fit those parameters and as you can see on the map there is a lot of sections that 
dangerous.</p>
