<h2>Nitrate Probability in the Minnesota River Watershed</h2>

<p>This project was the final for my GIS II class and my goal was to make a tool through model builder to 
replicate <a href="http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/eh/water/swp/nitrate/nitratemaps.html">MN county projects</a> 
that estimate how much nitrates, through things like fertilizers, are polluting surface/ground water. I chose to 
use the Minnesota River Watershed as an example for my tool. The 3 maps above are some of the inputs I had to gather
to rank what soil is most susceptible to pollutants to penetrate it. A higher rank on the map means that nitrate pollution 
is more likely to happen and the final product of this project combines all of the of rankings from the inputs. For most of 
the inputs I was able to easily get the data and rank according to what MN counties had done, but I was unable to get data on 
the water table. This data was crucial for determining the susceptibility of the soil, so I got the depth of all documented wells 
in MN from the county well index and used the Geostatisical Analyst tool to estimate the depth to the water table.</p>

<p>The picture above is a step by step process through model builder to do this for any area that you can find the data for.
As long as you have the inputs, the tool will do all the work and give you the two maps below. The Hydrogeologic Sensitvity 
map shows which are in the most danger if pollution happens. The Nitrate Probability map is the final result, it combines the 
hydrogeolgic sensitivity ranking data with the nitrate load from the map on the top of the page. The nitrate load ranking takes 
into account what the land is being used for such as industrial or agriculture and what crops if any are being grown. The areas
in the Minnesota River watershed that are in the most danger of polluting the water are those that are highly susceptible and
have heavy nitrate usage such as growing corn.</p>
