<h2>Geostatistical Analysis</h2>
<p>I believe this assignment was my first encounter with the Geostatiscal Analyst tool in ArcMap. 
Since then I have definitely grown to appreciate how useful it can be and love the maps that it 
can produce. Based on points scattered over California with data on ozone pollution I was able to 
predict the levels of ozone pollution through out the whole state.</p>
<p>As you can see based on the map on the right, it is not a perfect system. The areas where there are 
very low levels of error are where I had point data, and it only gets less accurate the farther away from 
the point you look. The are ways to reduce the level of error but this assignment was simply an introduction 
to the tool, but I do get to use a lot more of it in my GIS Statistics class.</p>
