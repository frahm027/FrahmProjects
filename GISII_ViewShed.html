<h2>Viewshed Analysis</h2>
<p>The process of creating this map started with collecting the DEM elevation coverage data and the
location of where the 3 towers were. The visibility tool in ARCGIS was used with DEM and Tower data as
inputs and using 90% of the height of the towers as the vertical offset. Using the Extract by Mask tool,
 I restricted what was being displayed to the city of Duluth.</p>
<p>The result is a cool looking map that shows what is visible from the tall radio towers on top of the hill.
 Using viewshed analysis can be very useful because if you are building a tall structure, especially in Duluth 
 to see the lake, you want to know what the view will be like from the windows or whether or not the strucutre 
 is obscuring a view for others</p>
<h3>Results</h3>
<ul>
<li>Percentage of Duluth that is covered by the 3 towers is 58%</li>
<li>Percentage of Duluth that is not covered at all is 30%</li>
<li>Percentage of Duluth covered by Duluth-Superior Educational Television is 4.5%</li>
